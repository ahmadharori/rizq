- **Repository Pattern**: Separate get_all() for list and get_by_id_with_full_details() for detail
- **Eager Loading**: Fixed joinedload chaining for nested relationships (province, city)
- **Status Handling**: Fixed recipient.status enum vs string serialization
- **Distance Calculation**: Leg-by-leg distances from depot through sequential stops

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Blockers
**None** - Backend setup complete, moving to frontend

### Resolved Issues
✅ **Bcrypt Python 3.13 Compatibility** - Switched from passlib to direct bcrypt usage
✅ **PostGIS Installation** - Installed PostGIS 3.5 via PostgreSQL Stack Builder
✅ **Database Connection** - Updated .env to use localhost:5432 (standard PostgreSQL port)
✅ **Regional Data Size** - Simplified from 4-level (83,000+ villages) to 2-level hierarchy (14 cities)
✅ **Missing is_deleted Column** - Added migration to include is_deleted in provinces and cities tables

### Pending Information
1. **Depot Location**: Actual warehouse coordinates needed (will use placeholder for MVP)
2. **Google API Keys**: Need to create Google Cloud Platform project for Maps API
3. **Hosting Provider**: Decision pending on AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean/Railway
4. **Initial User Data**: Migration data from existing system (if any)
5. **Recipient Data**: Need actual recipient data for testing (names, addresses, coordinates)

### Technical Risks
1. **CVRP Performance**: May need optimization if 60s timeout insufficient
2. **Google Maps Quota**: Monitor carefully to avoid overages
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Test thoroughly on target browsers

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Planning Decisions (January 10, 2025)

**Decision 1: Tech Stack Selection**
- **Chosen**: FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- **Rationale**: Modern, performant, excellent documentation
- **Alternatives Considered**: Django (too heavy), Node.js backend (team Python-focused)
- **Status**: Approved

**Decision 2: Single Depot for MVP**
- **Chosen**: Hardcode single depot location in Phase 1
- **Rationale**: Simplify MVP, multi-depot adds significant complexity
- **Future**: Phase 2 will add multi-depot support
- **Status**: Approved

**Decision 3: Open VRP (No Return to Depot)**
- **Chosen**: Couriers end routes at home, not warehouse
- **Rationale**: More realistic for actual operations
- **Impact**: Simpler algorithm, better user experience
- **Status**: Approved

**Decision 4: WhatsApp Deep Linking**
- **Chosen**: Use wa.me URLs instead of official API
- **Rationale**: No API key needed, simpler implementation
- **Limitation**: No automation, manual send by admin
- **Status**: Approved for MVP

---

## Next Milestone

### Sprint 1.1: Project Setup & Authentication (5 days)
**Target Date**: To be determined when development starts  
**Goal**: Working authentication + project skeleton

**Critical Path:**
1. Initialize Git repository
2. Setup Docker Compose (backend + frontend + PostgreSQL)
3. Create database schema with migrations
4. Implement JWT authentication
5. Build basic layout with protected routes

**Success Criteria:**
- Admin can login with username/password
- JWT token stored securely
- Protected routes redirect to login if not authenticated
- Basic layout renders (header, sidebar)
- Database schema created with PostGIS enabled
